# Simple-Diary
Currently in pre-alpha this program is a cli diary written entirely in cpp.
it's dirty, bloated and barely functioning but thats the point of a pre-Alpha.

goals for Pre-Alpha-2:
directory and search funtion for dates on entries (maybe semi-visual);
password and some kind of encryption

also- no i will not make a makefile until this project needs one which i doubt will be any time soon.
