# Simple-Diary
----------------------------------------------------------
Currently in pre-alpha this program is a cli diary written entirely in cpp.  
For latest updated use the exp version; it might work might not but the majority do though it might have some bugs

new features in Alpha_1.5.3:
----------------------------------------------------------
proto-type insert mode

goals for alpha_1.5.4:
----------------------------------------------------------
complete insert mode(finished in exp version)
graphical menu(text mode alt availible)  
arrow key navigation(optional)  
colored text  

also- no i will not make a makefile until this project needs one which i doubt will be any time soon.
