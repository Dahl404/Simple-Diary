# Simple-Diary
Currently in pre-alpha this program is a cli diary written entirely in cpp.
it's dirty, bloated and barely functioning but thats the point of a pre-Alpha.

new features in Alpha_1.5.3:
----------------------------------------------------------
proto-type insert mode

goals for alpha_1.5.4:
----------------------------------------------------------
complete insert mode  
graphical menu(text mode alt availible)  
arrow key navigation(optional) 
colored text  

goals by Alpha_1.7:
----------------------------------------------------------
sorting by date and impliment a text editor 

also- no i will not make a makefile until this project needs one which i doubt will be any time soon.
